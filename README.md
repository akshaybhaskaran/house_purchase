## Introduction

Finalizing, and purchasing a house, especially if it's your first one, is a tough process. You'll have to research various  websites to see which locations match your expectations, has a good neighborhood, is surrounded by a bunch of good hangout spots, has good school zones for your kids, and much more etc. Even if everything fits well, then comes the house. The house you'd want to live in should satisfy all your requirements without much of a compromise. In order to tackle this, I've come up with this project where the user's can see potential areas in and around the city of Austin, TX where purchasing a house would be a good deal in terms of the aforementioned requirements/expectations. 


## Data

We definitely need a lot of data to fire this project, and we'll be using the following sources to get our required data from:

   1. _FourSquare Location Data (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/endpoints) - we can use Four Square location APIs to find nearby venues, neighborhood, and famous places around a given spot_</br>
   2. _Zillow API (https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm) - Zillow is a great real estate website to gather more information about schools, house's rent, tax validation, and more etc._ </br></br>
   _(more data sources will be updated as the project kicks off)_
